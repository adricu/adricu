I am Adri√°n and I'm currently working at [Bitpanda](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitpanda/) as a Software Engineer.

I'm an experienced software engineer with a proven track record in designing, developing, and deploying secure and scalable solutions.

My recent focus has been on the blockchain space, where I've gained a deep understanding of its technology and applications. 

I'm passionate about creating not just functional, but elegant and high-performing software. Continuously seeking opportunities for improvement, I enhance code through efficient algorithms, refactoring, and restructuring. Dedicated to staying current with the latest advancements, I prioritize continuous learning and adherence to best practices in software development.
